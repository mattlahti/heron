The vertex shader is run for each vertex in the shape.
It transforms the input vertex from its original coordinate system into the "clipspace" coordinate system used by WebGL.

After the vertex shader is done processing, then the fragment shader is run.
The fragment shader is called once for every pixel on each shape to be drawn.
Basically, the fragment shader determines the color of the pixel by figuring out which texel (pixel from the shape's texture)
to apply, getting its color, and then applying the lighting.
